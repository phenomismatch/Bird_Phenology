Pheno Mismatch notes
===================


Notes from Oct 2018 meeting
===========================
Calculating mismatch -> caterpillar curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) and bird reproduction curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) -> overlay curves to calculate weighted index.
    Would expect positive relationship between productivity and curve area


*[DONE] Run single set of phi/theta
*[DONE] Run different phi/theta for each year
*[DONE] Run hierarchical phi/theta -> run time too long, params not estimated well
*[DONE] Run single year (2017) with just test set of cells - LARGE RHO
*[DONE] Fit all years with different phi/thetas and one phi/thetas
*[DONE] Filter cells by species ranges
*[DONE] Generalize creation of Stan script indices
*[DONE] Run V_olivaceus for all years/cells
    *[DONE] Check maps
*[DONE] Setup script to run one species at a time
*[DONE] Determine which species to run (separate script?)
*Run test set of species on Xanadu
*Run all species on Xanadu


#AFTER
*Run model nesting (Nestwatch) ~ arrival (IAR)
  -period between arrival and breeding may be plastic (as suggested for Black throated blues by Lany et al. 2016 - interval was shorter when greenup was earlier)
  -does the interval between arrival and nesting vary depending on 1) arrival/nesting time, 2) greenup time, or 3) the interval between arrival and greenup timing?
*Look at impact of green up on bird arrival (IAR)
  -are there other covariates that explain arrival well?
*Look at impact of green up on nesting date (Nestwatch, etc.)
  -are there other covariates that explain nesting well?




-So phenology may not be important for breeding success (predation may be important for breeding success)
-Is breeding success important for population dynamics of these birds (for black-throated blues it is according to citation in Lany et al. 2016)?
-Does the interval between arrival and nesting impact population growth rates (e.g., are shorter intervals associated with lower pop growth rates [as we don't have breeding success info])?
-Integrate weight measurements from MAPS data when investigating mismatch and demographics (calculate deviation from each individual mean weight in a given year and see if there is a year effect across all individuals - that might indicate whether this is a 'good' or 'bad' year) - year effect should be done on a per site basis - should be restricted to a specific time window
