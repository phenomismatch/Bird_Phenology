===================
Pheno Mismatch notes
===================


Notes from Oct 2018 meeting
===========================
Calculating mismatch -> caterpillar curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) and bird reproduction curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) -> overlay curves to calculate weighted index.
    Would expect positive relationship between productivity and curve area


*[DONE] Run single set of phi/theta
*[DONE] Run different phi/theta for each year
*[DONE] Run hierarchical phi/theta -> run time too long, params not estimated well
*[DONE] Run single year (2017) with just test set of cells - LARGE RHO
*[DONE] Fit all years with different phi/thetas and one phi/thetas
*[DONE] Filter cells by species ranges
*[DONE] Generalize creation of Stan script indices
*[DONE] Run V_olivaceus for all years/cells
    *[DONE] Check maps
*[DONE] Setup script to run one species at a time
*[DONE] Determine which species to run (separate script?)
*Run test set of species on Xanadu
*Run all species on Xanadu
