Pheno Mismatch notes
===================


Notes from Oct 2018 meeting
===========================
Calculating mismatch -> caterpillar curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) and bird reproduction curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) -> overlay curves to calculate weighted index.
    Would expect positive relationship between productivity and curve area


*Run arr/br model one species - cell random effect - is the effect of lat driving relationship between arr and br? (arrival predicts actual dates but not anomalies)


Demographics
============
*Spatially explicit integrated population model
    -look at how trends differ across species range
    -look at fluctuations in pop dynamics across species range
        -particularly as they pertain to range edges (recent paper about deforestation and range edges) -> larger fluctuations = less stable population
    -links to phenological dynamics
    -links to fat content/body mass from MAPS

#AFTER
*Run model nesting (Nestwatch) ~ arrival (IAR)
  -period between arrival and breeding may be plastic (as suggested for Black throated blues by Lany et al. 2016 - interval was shorter when greenup was earlier)
  -does the interval between arrival and nesting vary depending on 1) arrival/nesting time, 2) greenup time, or 3) the interval between arrival and greenup timing?
*Look at impact of green up on bird arrival (IAR)
  -are there other covariates that explain arrival well?
*Look at impact of green up on nesting date
  -are there other covariates that explain nesting well?



-Phenology may not be important for breeding success (predation may be important for breeding success)?
-Is breeding success important for population dynamics of these birds (for black-throated blues it is according to citation in Lany et al. 2016)?
-Does the interval between arrival and nesting impact population growth rates (e.g., are shorter intervals associated with lower pop growth rates [as we don't have breeding success info])?
-Integrate weight measurements from MAPS data when investigating mismatch and demographics (calculate deviation from each individual mean weight in a given year and see if there is a year effect across all individuals - that might indicate whether this is a 'good' or 'bad' year) - year effect should be done on a per site basis - should be restricted to a specific time window
