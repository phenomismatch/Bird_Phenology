Pheno Mismatch notes

Notes from Oct 2018 meeting
===========================
Calculating mismatch -> caterpillar curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) and bird reproduction curve (abundance/biomass on y, time on x) -> overlay curves to calculate weighted index.
    Would expect positive relationship between productivity and curve area


*Run arr/br model one species - cell random effect - is the effect of lat driving relationship between arr and br? (arrival predicts actual dates but not anomalies)

*Model change in br over lat/time and interaction
  -each species y ~ N(alpha_j + beta_j * year); beta_j = alpha2 + beta2 * lat
*Model change in arr over lat/time and interaction
  -run arrival model with all years of data, not just matching BS
  -each species y ~ N(alpha_j + beta_j * year); beta_j = alpha2 + beta2 * lat
  -could be fit jointly (i = cell, j = year, k = species:
    y[i,j,k] ~ N(alpha[j,k] + beta[j,k] * year[i,j,k])
    beta[j,k] = alpha2[k] + beta2[k] * lat[i,j,k]
    for each k:
      for each j:
        alpha[j,k] ~ N(mu_alpha[k], sigma_alpha[k])
      alpha2[k] ~ N(0, 10)
      beta2[k] ~ N(0, 10)
      mu_alpha[k] ~ N(mu_mu_alpha, sigma_mu_alpha)
      sigma_alpha ~ HN(mu_sigma_alpha, sigma_sigma_alpha)
    mu_mu_alpha ~ N(0, 10)
    sigma_mu_alpha ~ HN(0, 10)
    mu_sigma_alpha ~ N(0, 10)
    sigma_sigma_alpha ~ HN(0, 10)

*Check differences between y_true from br_arr and y_true from br_time
*Could get derived qty for y_true and x_true from above models - then model change in diff (controlling for arrival)



*Generate qty: difference between ARR and BR -> birds compress the wait period later in the season (evidenced by the slope - breeding advances at a slower rate than arrival within a given season); has this interval changed over time (can model this is a few data-rich species - year effect on slope parameter)?
Diff_arr_br ~ alpha_j + beta1_j * year + beta2_j * arr #where j is species



*Aggregate MAPS cells and test logit models for MAPS breeding
*Run fat ~ lat/time

####
*lat differences in territory - leapfrogging migratory strategies
*Pete Mara - Kriten Ruegg
  -wood/sqainsons thrush
####

*For 7 - maybe run additional models with term that includes number of breeding obs recorded, just to make sure that number of people recording breeders has risen consistently with the number of eBird surveys - restrict 7 run by years? Missing IAR ARR could be informed by existing covariates at those positions




Demographics
============
*Spatially explicit integrated population model
    -look at how trends differ across species range
    -look at fluctuations in pop dynamics across species range
        -particularly as they pertain to range edges (recent paper about deforestation and range edges) -> larger fluctuations = less stable population
    -links to phenological dynamics
    -links to fat content/body mass from MAPS

#AFTER
*Run model nesting (Nestwatch) ~ arrival (IAR)
  -period between arrival and breeding may be plastic (as suggested for Black throated blues by Lany et al. 2016 - interval was shorter when greenup was earlier)
  -does the interval between arrival and nesting vary depending on 1) arrival/nesting time, 2) greenup time, or 3) the interval between arrival and greenup timing?
*Look at impact of green up on bird arrival (IAR)
  -are there other covariates that explain arrival well?
*Look at impact of green up on nesting date
  -are there other covariates that explain nesting well?



-Phenology may not be important for breeding success (predation may be important for breeding success)?
-Is breeding success important for population dynamics of these birds (for black-throated blues it is according to citation in Lany et al. 2016)?
-Does the interval between arrival and nesting impact population growth rates (e.g., are shorter intervals associated with lower pop growth rates [as we don't have breeding success info])?
-Integrate weight measurements from MAPS data when investigating mismatch and demographics (calculate deviation from each individual mean weight in a given year and see if there is a year effect across all individuals - that might indicate whether this is a 'good' or 'bad' year) - year effect should be done on a per site basis - should be restricted to a specific time window
