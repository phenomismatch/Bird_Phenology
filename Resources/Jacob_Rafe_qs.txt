*incidentals - not filtering them out at the moment as don't have the capacity to do that from database

Rafe
====
#Are missing ids all incidental? NO
*ask rafe to update ebird dataset (updated monthly now - to get 2018 data)
*ask rafe to add Nestwatch data as well

*there is no PROTOCOL_TYPE field in DB
*could probs eliminate 'has media' col
*how many 'cores' do we have on the server that hosts the phenomismatch database (for querying purposes)
*subspecies - does a query with a species return subspecies also?
